9/5 1979 - Ralph Merkle files patent for "Merkle Tree" .

9/6 2011 - Mike Caldwell begins minting physical Bitcoins, naming the coins Casacius Coins.	
9/7 2010 - "Another option is to reduce the number of free transactions allowed per block before transaction fees are required.  Nodes only take so many KB of free transactions per block before they start requiring at least 0.01 transaction fee. The threshold should probably be lower than it currently is. I don't think the threshold should ever be 0.  We should always allow at least some free transactions."	
9/8 2010 - "The threshold can easily be changed in the future.  We can decide to increase it when the time comes.  It's a good idea to keep it lower as a circuit breaker and increase it as needed.  If we hit the threshold now, it would almost certainly be some kind of flood and not actual use.  Keeping the threshold lower would help limit the amount of wasted disk space in that event."
    2010 - "Currently, paying a fee is controlled manually with the -paytxfee switch.  It would be very easy to make the software automatically check the size of recent blocks to see if it should pay a fee.  We're so far from reaching the threshold, we don't need that yet.  It's a good idea to see how things go with controlling it manually first anyway."

9/19 2010 -  "I don't know anything about any of the bug trackers.  If we were to have one, we would have to make a thoroughly researched choice. We're managing pretty well just using the forum.  I'm more likely to see bugs posted in the forum, and I think other users are much more likely to help resolve and ask follow up questions here than if they were in a bug tracker.  A key step is other users helping resolve the simple stuff that's not really a bug but some misunderstanding or confusion. I keep a list of all unresolved bugs I've seen on the forum.  In some cases, I'm still thinking about the best design for the fix.  This isn't the kind of software where we can leave so many unresolved bugs that we need a tracker for them."

9/30 2010 - "I wish rather than deleting the article, they put a length restriction.  If something is not famous enough, there could at least be a stub article identifying what it is.  I often come across annoying red links of things that Wiki ought to at least have heard of. \nThe article could be as simple as something like  "Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer decentralised electronic currency." The more standard Wiki thing to do is that we should have a paragraph in one of the more general categories that we are an instance of, like Electronic Currency or Electronic Cash.  We can probably establish a paragraph there.  Again, keep it short.  Just identifying what it is."
     2010 - "As you figured out, the root problem is we shouldn't be counting or spending transactions until they have at least 1 confirmation.  0/unconfirmed transactions are very much second class citizens.  At most, they are advice that something has been received, but counting them as balance or spending them is premature."
